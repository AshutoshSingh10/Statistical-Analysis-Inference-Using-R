# Statistical Analysis to study the Factors Affecting Student's Performance in Secondary School

This study is associated with finding the factors which can impact the student's performance in Secondary school. It was conducted over the data of 382 students collected from two different Portuguese schools( Link is available in rmd file). 

The project contains two rmd files, the first one deals with identifying the important predictors from the data. Hypothesis testing was performed on different variables including the different concepts which can be useful in giving the most accurate and relevant results. The initial exploration checked for the correlation between the selected variables, observed the difference between one parametric and one categorical variable with two and more than two groups, the differences in performance at two different time intervals. 

The second rmd file builds upon those significant predictors and identifies more variables like higher education(higher.m), mother’s education(medu) which can be proved useful to predict the factors influencing student’s performance in secondary school. Later, total three models were developed, out of which model 1 and 2 are based upon Linear Regression and model 3 is based upon Logistic Regression.
